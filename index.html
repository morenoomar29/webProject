          <p>
            Born and raised in Mexico City up until the age of 16, Omar went to the best private school in Mexico (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.colegiowilliams.mx.edu">Colegio Williams</a>) from 2nd to 10th grade. There is where he learned to read and write good English. When he came to the United States in 1994, he already knew how to speak, write and converse proper grammatical English. He first lived in Napa, CA. for 1 year, then in Chicago for 4 years and finally he moved to San Antonio, Tx in 1999 where he has lived ever since.

          After graduating from high school, Omar studied one year of Computer Science basic courses in Richard J. Daley college in Chicago. But, did not finish a degree on that Major because he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do for work. Around that that, he moved down to San Antonio, Tx. He went to San Antonio College for another year just covering basic classes not being sure what to study. Omar held different jobs after that going from working in a call center to being a waiter.

          In 2011, he enrolled in Hallmark University in the Computer Networking program. He didn’t finish that Associate degree. But after a year of assisting to the Computer Networking program, he found a job as a Server Support Analyst at Globalscape. Omar spent the last 9 years of his life at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.globalscape.com">Globalscape</a> from 2012 to 2021. He started as a Level I analyst and ended as a Level II support analyst. At Globalscape, a Software company, he provided second level technical assistance to clients as it relates to Globalscape’s Enhanced File Transfer Platform.

          Omar resigned of the Server Support Analyst position in April 2021 looking for a career change. He began assessing what branch of Information Technology he would be focusing on. After considering Data Science, Cyber Security and Web Design, he narrowed it down to Software Engineering. Omar started researching the different bootcamps available and decided to go with FlatIron School because he saw the great reviews it received.
